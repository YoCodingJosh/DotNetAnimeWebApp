# AnimeWebApp

Really just something to tinker around with ASP.NET MVC and calling a 3rd party API

You really shouldn't use this for anything remotely useful ðŸ˜‚

Only endpoints so far:

* `/Anime/{myanimelist_anime_id}`
	* Example: `/Anime/15583` will return the data for Date A Live.
* `Watchlist/{username}/{anime_id}
	* Example: `/Watchlist/CodingJosh/35849` will return the anime data and my watch list data for Darling in the FranXX
